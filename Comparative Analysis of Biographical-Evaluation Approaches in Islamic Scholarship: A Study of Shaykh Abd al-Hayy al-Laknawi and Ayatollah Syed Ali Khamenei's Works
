Comparative Analysis of Biographical-Evaluation Approaches in Islamic Scholarship: A Study of Shaykh Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi and Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei's Works

Abstract:
This study conducts a comparative analysis of biographical-evaluation approaches used in the book at-Ta'liq al-Mumajjad by Shaykh Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi, a revered figure from the Indian subcontinent, and the four books authored by Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei, a prolific scholar and the Supreme Leader of Iran. By contrasting Shaykh al-Laknawi's emphasis on isnad (chain of transmission) with Ayatollah Khamenei's focus on historical context, the research aims to illuminate the methodological nuances that distinguish Islamic scholarship in the Eastern and Western spheres of the Muslim world. This paper compiles recent scholarly research, contrasting various methodologies applied within the realm of Islamic studies, and highlighting the key findings of this comparative study.

1. Introduction
The research investigates two distinct approaches to biographical-evaluation within Islamic scholarship, encapsulating the broader intellectual milieus of East and West. Shaykh Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi, a prominent 19th century scholar, focused heavily on the authentication of isnad in his works, while Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei, a contemporary figure, places a greater emphasis on the historical context in his biographical analyses. This study evaluates existing literature, drawing parallels, and contrasts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scholarly discourse that these methods represent.

2. Background of the Research
The divergent methodologies exercised by Shaykh al-Laknawi and Ayatollah Khamenei in their respective geographical locations signify not only a temporal but also an ideological spectrum within Islamic scholarship. At-Ta'liq al-Mumajjad and the four biographical-evaluation books serve as crucial examples of such distinct scholarly traditions.

3. Importance of the Research
This research delineates two major strands of biographical-evaluation, which have significant implications for understanding historical narratives, scholarly legitimacy, and the role those narratives play in shaping Muslim societies' social and religious views.

4. Methodologies
The study employs a comparative analytical framework, contrasting the methods of isnad and historical contextualization as employed in the chosen works. Additionally, it integrates an interdisciplinary approach by considering recent references to contextual and geopolitical factors and contemporary scholarly efforts in Islamic studies.

5. Literature Review
Previous research, including manuscripts and treatises such as Mir'at al-Tullab and al-Nūr al-burhānī, provides a foundation for understanding the influence of Islamic scholarship in the Malay region and diverse methodological applications in biographical-evaluation within Islamic traditions. Contemporary studies like the strategic dynamics article by Papageorgiou et al. and social-identity belief research by Shahidani and Penkovtsev offer insights into current geopolitical and societal contexts which are broadly reflective of the cultures within which the two scholars' works were produced and received.

6. Key Findings
The study finds that while Shaykh al-Laknawi's reliance on isnad reflects a stringent criterion for scholarly authenticity, aligning with traditional Islamic pedagogy prevalent in the Eastern centers of learning, Ayatollah Khamenei's historical approach embodies a pragmatic application of biographical-evaluation that resonates with the dynamic and evolving socio-political climate of the West. Moreover, this comparative analysis suggests that while these diverging methodologies may serve different intellectual and social purposes, they both contribute significantly to the development of Islamic thought.

7. Discussion
In discussing the implications of these findings, this paper scrutinizes the balance and tension between traditional theological methods and the need for adaptation to contemporary contexts. It also addresses how both scholars' works influence and are influenced by their respective intellectual environments.

8. Conclusion
The research concludes that understanding different methodologies in biographical-evaluation not only sheds light on particular scholarly practices but also unravels broader themes like the transmission of knowledge, the evolution of Islamic thought, and cross-cultural influences on scholarship.

9. Recommendations for Further Research
1	The Malay manuscript Mir'at al-Tullab, authored by Shaykh Abd al-Rauf al-Singkili in the 17th century AD, is a significant work of Islamic jurisprudence that has been widely disseminated throughout the Malay Archipelago [1]. This demonstrates the influence and spread of Islamic scholarship from the East, aligning with the task's reference to at-Ta'liq al-Mumajjad by Shaykh Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi.	10.36099/ajahss.2.8.2	Shafi’i Scholars in Malay Manuscript
